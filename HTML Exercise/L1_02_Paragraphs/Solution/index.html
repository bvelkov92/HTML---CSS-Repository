    <h1>Principles For Clean HTML Code</h1>
    <p><span id="bolding">Beautiful and clean HTML</span> is the foundation 
        of a beautiful website. 
        When I teach people about <span style="font-weight: bold;">CSS</span>,
         I always begin by telling them that good 
         <span style="font-weight: bold;">CSS</span> can only exist with equally good HTML markup. 
         A house is only as strong as its foundation, right? 
         The advantages of <span style="font-weight: bold;">clean, semantic HTML</span> are many, 
         yet so many websites suffer from poorly written 
         markup.</p>
             <p><span id="bolding">Strict DOCTYPE</span>. If we are going to do this, 
                let’s just do it right. No need for a discussion about whether 
                to use <span id="italic"> HTML 4.01</span> or <span id="italic">XHTML 1.0</span>: both of them offer a strict 
             version that will keep us nice and honest as 
             we write our code.</p>
             <p><span id="bolding"> Character set & encoding characters</span>. In our &lt;head&gt; section, 
                    the very first thing should be the <span id="bolding">declaration</span> 
                    of our 
                    character set. We’re using <span id="bolding">UTF-8</span>  here, which is swell, 
                    but it’s listed after our &lt;title&gt;.
                         Let’s go ahead and move it up so that the
                          browser knows what character set 
                    it’s dealing with before it starts reading any 
                    content at all.</p>
                    <p>The next time you write <span id="bolding">HTML</span>, be it a small chunk in a huge website, or the beginning of a fresh new project,
                         just do what you can to make it <span id="bolding">right</span>.</p>
                    <p id="italic">The interwebs will love you!</p>
